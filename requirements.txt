# requirements.txt
# Python package dependencies for the EDI Claims Processor project
# --- Core Libraries ---
python-dotenv         # For managing environment variables (especially for secrets not in config.yaml)
PyYAML                # For reading and parsing config.yaml

# --- Database Interaction ---
SQLAlchemy>=1.4,<2.0    # Core ORM Toolkit. Specify version range for stability.
psycopg2-binary         # PostgreSQL database adapter
pyodbc                # ODBC database adapter (for SQL Server)

# --- Rules Engine ---
pyDatalog             # For implementing the rules engine using Datalog logic

alembic # For database migrations (optional, but highly recommended for production)
# --- Web API (FastAPI) ---
fastapi               # Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
uvicorn[standard]     # ASGI server to run FastAPI (includes websockets, http-tools, etc.)

# pydantic is a dependency of FastAPI, usually installed with it. Explicitly listing can be good.
pydantic>=1.8,<2.0     # Data validation and settings management using Python type hints

# --- Data Handling & Machine Learning ---
pandas                # Powerful data analysis and manipulation library (for RVU data, ML features)
numpy                 # Fundamental package for scientific computing (often a pandas/scikit-learn dependency)
scikit-learn          # Machine learning library (for the example classifier, preprocessing, metrics)
joblib                # For saving and loading Python objects (e.g., scikit-learn models)

# --- Asynchronous Operations & HTTP Clients ---
asyncio # is part of the standard library
httpx                 # A fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, with sync and async capabilities (e.g., for external service calls)

# --- Development & Testing (Optional - can be in a separate dev-requirements.txt) ---
pytest
pytest-asyncio # For testing asyncio code with pytest
coverage # For code coverage measurement
black # Uncompromising Python code formatter
flake8 # Linter for style guide enforcement
mypy # Optional static type checker
